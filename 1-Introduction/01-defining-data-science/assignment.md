# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | Assessing students' engagement and enthusiasm. | Assignment submissions. Attendance records. Grades. | Semi or unstructures (assignments) - NoSQL or file-system. Grades & attendance - structured - table. | Identify students that aren't engaged so we can investigate. |
| Vaccination | In which areas are people not being vaccinated quickly enough? | Population of counties/districts. Numbers of vaccinations in each geographical area (with dates) | Structured table | Charts and maps to show which areas are lagging behind. Focus resources on them. |
| Productivity | Am I engaging with enough colleagues, often enough? | Dates, lengths and attendees of meetings; Emails & chat messages sent & received vs recipients. Group posts & comments. Locations of colleagues. | Semi-structured data. NoSQL? | Network diagram to see connections and activity showing gaps in my "coverage". Analysis of topics indicating what my effort is being expended on and decide whether the balance is appropriate. |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
